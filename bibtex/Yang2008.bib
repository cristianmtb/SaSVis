abstract ={Summary: QTLNetwork is a software package for mapping and visualizing the genetic architecture underlying complex traits for experimental populations derived from a cross between two inbred lines. It can simultaneously map quantitative trait loci (QTL) with individual effects, epistasis and QTLâ€“environment interaction. Currently, it is able to handle data from F2, backcross, recombinant inbred lines and double-haploid populations, as well as populations from specific mating designs (immortalized F2 and BCnFn populations). The Windows version of QTLNetwork was developed with a graphical user interface. Alternatively, the command-line versions have the facility to be run in other prevalent operating systems, such as Linux, Unix and MacOS.Availability: http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/software/qtlnetworkContact: jzhu@zju.edu.cn},
