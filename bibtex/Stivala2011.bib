abstract ={Summary: Protein topology diagrams are 2D representations of protein structure that are particularly useful in understanding and analysing complex protein folds. Generating such diagrams presents a major problem in graph drawing, with automatic approaches often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results. Here we apply a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons, providing clear, accurate, interactive and editable diagrams, which are also an interface to a structural search method.Availability: Pro-origami is available via a web server at http://munk.csse.unimelb.edu.au/pro-origamiContact: a.stivala@pgrad.unimelb.edu.au; pjs@csse.unimelb.edu.au},
