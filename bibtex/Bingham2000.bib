abstract ={Summary: HyperTree is an application to visualize and
 navigate large trees in hyperbolic space. It includes color-coding,
 search mechanisms and navigational aids, as well as focus+context
 viewing, allowing enormous trees to fit within the fixed space of a
 computer screen or printed page.Availability: A demo is available online at http://www.kinase.com/tools/HyperTree.htmlContact: sucha-sudarsanam@sugen.com},
