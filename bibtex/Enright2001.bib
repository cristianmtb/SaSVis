abstract ={Summary: Graph layout is extensively used in the field of
 mathematics and computer science, however these ideas and methods
 have not been extended in a general fashion to the construction of
 graphs for biological data. To this end, we have implemented a
 version of the Fruchterman Rheingold graph layout algorithm,
 extensively modified for the purpose of similarity analysis in
 biology. This algorithm rapidly and effectively generates clear two
 (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphs representing similarity
 relationships such as protein sequence similarity. The implementation
 of the algorithm is general and applicable to most types of
 similarity information for biological data.Availability: BioLayout is available for most UNIX platforms at
