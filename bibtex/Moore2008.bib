abstract ={Summary: TreeMos is a novel high-throughput graphical analysis application that allows the user to search for phylogenetic mosaicism among one or more DNA or protein sequence multiple alignments and additional unaligned sequences. TreeMos uses a sliding window and local alignment algorithm to identify the nearest neighbour of each sequence segment, and visualizes instances of sequence segments whose nearest neighbour is anomalous to that identified using the global alignment. Data sets can include whole genome sequences allowing phylogenomic analyses in which mosaicism may be attributed to recombination between any two points in the genome. TreeMos can be run from the command line, or within a web browser allowing the relationships between taxa to be explored by drill-through.Availability: http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/whri/research/archaeobotanyContact: jonathan.moore@warwick.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
