abstract ={Summary: We describe a general multiplatform exploratory tool called TreeQ-Vista, designed for presenting functional annotations in a phylogenetic context. Traits, such as phenotypic and genomic properties, are interactively queried from a user-provided relational database with a user-friendly interface which provides a set of tools for users with or without SQL knowledge. The query results are projected onto a phylogenetic tree and can be displayed in multiple color groups. A rich set of browsing, grouping and query tools are provided to facilitate trait exploration, comparison and analysis.Availability: The program, detailed tutorial and examples are available online (http:/genome.lbl.gov/vista/TreeQVista).Contact: vista@lbl.gov},
