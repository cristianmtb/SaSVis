abstract ={Summary: We have implemented a graph layout algorithm that exposes Gene Ontology (GO) class structure on the network nodes. It can be used in conjunction with BiNGO plug-in to Cytoscape, which finds the GO categories over-represented in a given network. Our plug-in, named GOlorize, first highlights the class members with category-specific color-coding and then constructs an enhanced visualization of the network using a class-directed layout algorithmAvailability: http://www.cytoscape.org/plugins2.phpContact:teanai@pasteur.frSupplementary information: Installation instructions and tutorial at http://www.cytoscape.org/plugins/GOlorize/GOlorizeUserGuide.pdf},
