abstract ={Summary: Treevolution is a tool for the representation and exploration of phylogenetic trees that facilitates visual analysis. There are several useful tools to visualize phylogenetic trees, but their level of interaction is usually low, especially in the case of radial representations. Highly interactive visualizations can improve the exploration and understanding of phylogenetic trees. Treevolution implements strategies to interact with phylogenetic trees in order to allow a more thorough analysis by users.Availability: Treevolution is available at http://vis.usal.es/treevolution. Additional figures, a user's guide, a video demo and some examples are available at the same site.Contact: rodri@usal.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
