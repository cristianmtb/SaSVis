abstract ={Summary: VistaClara is a plug-in for Cytoscape which provides a more flexible means to visualize gene and protein expression within a network context. An extended attribute browser is provided in the form of a graphical and interactive permutation matrix that resembles the heat map displays popular in gene-expression analysis. This extended browser permits a variety of display options and interactions not currently available in Cytoscape.Availability: http://chianti.ucsd.edu/cyto_web/plugins/index.phpContact: robert_kincaid@agilent.com},
