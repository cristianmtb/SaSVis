abstract ={Summary: The relationship between genes and proteins is a dynamic relationship that changes across time and differs in different cells. The study of these differences can reveal various insights into biological processes and disease progression, especially with the aid of proper tools for network visualization. Toward this purpose, we have developed TVNViewer, a novel visualization tool, which is specifically designed to aid in the exploration and analysis of dynamic networks.Availability: TVNViewer is freely available with documentation and tutorials on the web at http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/tvnviewer.Contact: epxing@cs.cmu.edu},
