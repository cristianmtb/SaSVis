abstract ={Summary: Hilbert curves enable high-resolution visualization of genomic data on a chromosome- or genome-wide scale. Here we present the HilbertCurve package that provides an easy-to-use interface for mapping genomic data to Hilbert curves. The package transforms the curve as a virtual axis, thereby hiding the details of the curve construction from the user. HilbertCurve supports multiple-layer overlay that makes it a powerful tool to correlate the spatial distribution of multiple feature types.Availability and implementation: The HilbertCurve package and documentation are freely available from the Bioconductor project: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/HilbertCurve.htmlContact:m.schlesner@dkfz.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
