abstract="The interpretation of the results from genome-scale experiments is a challenging and important problem in contemporary biomedical research. Biological networks that integrate experimental results with existing knowledge from biomedical databases and published literature can provide a rich resource and powerful basis for hypothesizing about mechanistic explanations for observed gene-phenotype relationships. However, the size and density of such networks often impede their efficient exploration and understanding.",
