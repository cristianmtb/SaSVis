abstract ={               Summary: ProViz is a tool for the visualization of proteinâ€“protein interaction networks, developed by the IntAct European project. It provides facilities for navigating in large graphs and exploring biologically relevant features, and adopts emerging standards such as GO and PSI-MI.               Availability: ProViz is available under the GPL and may be freely downloaded. Source code and binaries are available at http://cbi.labri.fr/eng/proviz.htm                           Contact:                david.sherman@labri.fr            },
