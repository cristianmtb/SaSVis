abstract ={Motivation: Availability of the sequences of entire genomes shifts the
scientific curiosity towards the identification of function of
the genomes in large scale as in genome studies. In the near
future, data produced about cellular processes at molecular
level will accumulate with an accelerating rate as a result of
proteomics studies. In this regard, it is essential to develop
tools for storing, integrating, accessing, and analyzing this
data effectively.Results: We define an ontology for a comprehensive representation of
cellular events. The ontology presented here enables integration
of fragmented or incomplete pathway information and supports
manipulation and incorporation of the stored data, as well as
multiple levels of abstraction. Based on this ontology, we
present the architecture of an integrated environment named
Patika (Pathway Analysis Tool for Integration and Knowledge
Acquisition). Patika is composed of a server-side, scalable,
object-oriented database and client-side editors to provide an
integrated, multi-user environment for visualizing and
manipulating network of cellular events.  This tool features
automated pathway layout, functional computation support,
advanced querying and a user-friendly graphical interface.We expect that Patika will be a valuable tool for rapid knowledge
acquisition, microarray generated large-scale data
interpretation, disease gene identification, and drug
development.Availability: A prototype of Patika is available upon
request from the authors.Contact: patika@cs.bilkent.edu.tr
